          h3 GymBud: How does it work?
          p.
            GymBud UCLA is designed for two types of UCLA students: the gym enthusiasts and the aspiring/new gym users. 
            We have created a database that connects these two types of students to create a mentorship program that is 
            beneficial to each party. Following an extensive screening process, 
            we have chosen the most qualified student, gym enthusiasts to become GymBud Trainers, 
            who have the gym experience and expert fitness knowledge to mentor a New Gym User. 
            GymBud will assist in matching up the Trainers and New Gym Users based on their shared workout interests, goals and compatibility. 
            We have made it easy for our users to get in contact with their new GymBud through our online chat system, where GymBuds are able to exchange information 
            and set up their personal workout experience. Our trainers are offering up their gym expertise 
            at an extremely affordable rate and a substantially lower cost than professional, 
            personal trainers which is why this service ideal for college students.
