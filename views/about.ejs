				Our Story
				<br>
				<small>
					Looking back on our previous gym experience, 
					we realized how difficult it was to start going to the gym.
				</small>
			</h1>
			
			<p>
			Between all of the different machines, exercises, crossfit, 
			cardio machines, and dumbbells, it was intimidating to start. 
			We then realized that this is most likely something that keeps 
			people from getting healthier with regular exercise. We also 
			realized that people like meeting people interested in the same 
			thing they are and often look up to those more seasoned.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			From there, GymBud was born.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			GymBud allows both new and seasoned gym-goers an opportunity 
			to meet one another and helps foster a learning environment in 
			the gym. GymBuds can also chat with their own skill level and 
			meet up with each other at the gym.  This is a great way to give 
			back to your fellow UCLA students as well as potentially meet 
			some lifelong friends.  So come on in and <a href='/signup'>join 
			today!</a>
